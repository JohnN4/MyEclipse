Servlet Scopes:

Scope is a section of code or location of execution in which data is valid and accessible.

Servlet scopes have to do with how data is accessible within a JavaEE application.

1. Request Scope - Things in the request object are created for each request, and this data
	disappears after the request is completed. Data in the request object. Think: Form data,
	request-url, request body, etc.
	
2. Session Scope - Things in a session will survive between requests but are scoped to 
	individual users through the JSESSIONID cookie. This data is not persisted between
	application runs.
	
3. Servlet Scope - A parameter that is defined and accessible only within a single servlet. Defined
	in the web.xml document. Key-value pairs.

4. Application Scope - A parameter that is defined and accessible from any servlet. Defined in
	the web.xml document. Key-value pairs.
